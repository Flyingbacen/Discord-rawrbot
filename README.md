# Discord-rawrbot

my discord bot for Salem's server

If you wish to join the server, please use this [link](https://discord.gg/phHzxjNWbq)

If you wish to add the bot, do so [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1118629362368008283&permissions=2147486720&scope=bot&permissions=2147486720&scope=messages.read%20bot)

The only dependency you need is discord.py (I think).

Let's start a changelog ig?
yeah no, that's not being updated.
I may make a list of all commands eventually though?
