# Discord-rawrbot

my discord bot for Salem's server

If you wish to join the server, please use this [link](https://discord.gg/phHzxjNWbq)

If you wish to add the bot, do so [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1118629362368008283&permissions=2147486720&scope=bot&permissions=2147486720&scope=messages.read%20bot)

The only dependency you need is discord.py (I think).

Let's start a changelog ig?
#### 1.idk,1?
- removed a giant comment of unused code (not sure if this was pushed, but I removed it from my own)
- Used a JSON file to store stuff instead, so that it's easier for other people
- added a new function to grab stuffs from the thing. Probably a better way to do it tbh
- added emojis to counting
- if you store the token in base64, then it auto undoes it. You don't need to change it to base64 if you already have it not in that. (I'm just too lazy to change it back for my own token)
